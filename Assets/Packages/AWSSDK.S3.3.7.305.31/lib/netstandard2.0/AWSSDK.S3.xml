            Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.
            
             
            <para>
            You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>

            operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call
            this <c>CompleteMultipartUpload</c> operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving
            this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number
            to create a new object. In the CompleteMultipartUpload request, you must provide the
            parts list and ensure that the parts list is complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload
            API operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in
            the list, you must provide the <c>PartNumber</c> value and the <c>ETag</c> value that
            are returned after that part was uploaded.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request could take several minutes to
            finalize. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response
            header that specifies a <c>200 OK</c> response. While processing is in progress, Amazon
            S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out.
            A request could fail after the initial <c>200 OK</c> response has been sent. This
            means that a <c>200 OK</c> response can contain either a success or an error. The
            error response might be embedded in the <c>200 OK</c> response. If you call this API
            operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of
            the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs
            handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling
            per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate).
            If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't
            use exceptions, they return an error).

            Creates a session that establishes temporary security credentials to support fast

            To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory bucket, use the <c>CreateSession</c>
            API operation. Specifically, you grant <c>s3express:CreateSession</c> permission to
            a bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM credentials
            to make the <c>CreateSession</c> API request on the bucket, which returns temporary
            security credentials that include the access key ID, secret access key, session token,
            and expiration. These credentials have associated permissions to access the Zonal
            endpoint APIs. After the session is created, you don’t need to use other policies
            to grant permissions to each Zonal endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal
            endpoint API requests, you sign your requests by applying the temporary security credentials
            of the session to the request headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication.
            You also apply the session token to the <c>x-amz-s3session-token</c> request header
            for authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to the bucket and expire
            after 5 minutes. After the expiration time, any calls that you make with those credentials

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by
            automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without
            performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic
            cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
            storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate
            additional archiving capabilities.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with
            unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or
            retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
            and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
            charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            the <c>GetBucketPolicy</c>, <c>PutBucketPolicy</c>, and <c>DeleteBucketPolicy</c>
            API actions, even if their bucket policy explicitly denies the root principal's access.
            Bucket owner root principals can only be blocked from performing these API actions
            by VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web Services Organizations policies.

            The request can contain a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by
            automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without
            performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic
            cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
            storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate
            additional archiving capabilities.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with
            unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or
            retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
            and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
            charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            settings are different between the bucket and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most

             <b>General purpose buckets</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
            rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
            decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that
            are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify
            encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts
            is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default,
            all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption
            with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption
            configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS)
            key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding
            KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform
            a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption
            setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object
            with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a
            customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from
            the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting
            in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key,

             <b>General purpose buckets</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
            rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
            decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that
            are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify
            encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts
            is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default,
            all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption
            with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption
            configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS)
            key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding
            KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform
            a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption
            setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object
            with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a
            customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from
            the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting
            in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key,
            the request headers you provide in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>

            Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more

            ACLs</a>. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have the <c>WRITE_ACP</c> permission.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Specify the ACL in the request body
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            Specify permissions using request headers
            </para>
             </li> </ul> <note> 
            <para>
            You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.
            </para>
             </note> 
            <para>
            Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using
            either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application
            that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that
            approach.
            </para>
             <important> 
            <para>
            If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs
            are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access
            to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and
            return the <c>AccessControlListNotSupported</c> error code. Requests to read ACLs
            are still supported. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html">Controlling
            object ownership</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.

             </important> <dl> <dt>Permissions</dt> <dd> 
            <para>
            You can set access permissions by using one of the following methods:
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Specify a canned ACL with the <c>x-amz-acl</c> request header. Amazon S3 supports
            a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined
            set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <c>x-amz-acl</c>.
            If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your
            request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned
            ACL</a>.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            Specify access permissions explicitly with the <c>x-amz-grant-read</c>, <c>x-amz-grant-read-acp</c>,
            <c>x-amz-grant-write-acp</c>, and <c>x-amz-grant-full-control</c> headers. When using
            these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services
            accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific
            headers, you cannot use the <c>x-amz-acl</c> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters
            map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information,
            see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access
            Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with
            unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or
            retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
            and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
            charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket on a daily
            or weekly basis, and the results are published to a flat file. The bucket that is
            inventoried is called the <i>source</i> bucket, and the bucket where the inventory
            flat file is stored is called the <i>destination</i> bucket. The <i>destination</i>
            bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the <i>source</i> bucket.

            After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification

            and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending a test notification.
            In the case of Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions
            grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more

            By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However,

            The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification
            configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When
            you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your
            SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will
            not add the configuration to your bucket.

            a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <c>CreateSession</c>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <c>CreateSession</c> API call to generate a new session token for
            use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token
            automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information
            about authorization, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html">

            Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or
            S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier
            Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of
            the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy
            of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived
            object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.
            For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved
            into the Frequent Access tier.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide
            a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access
            tier options in the <c>Tier</c> element of the request body: 
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Expedited</c> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored
            in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required.
            For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
            retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
            that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
            retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3
            Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Standard</c> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
            within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not
            specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage
            class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Bulk</c> - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
            Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large
            amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within
            5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the
            lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
            They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

            You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster
            speed while it is in progress. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html">

            <para>
            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <c>HEAD</c> request. Operations
            return the <c>x-amz-restore</c> header, which provides information about the restoration
            status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when
            a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring
            Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
            request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
            about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

            Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or
            S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier
            Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of
            the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy
            of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived
            object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.
            For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved
            into the Frequent Access tier.

            To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide

            <para>
            When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access
            tier options in the <c>Tier</c> element of the request body:

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Expedited</c> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored
            in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required.
            For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
            retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
            that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
            retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3
            Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Standard</c> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
            within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not
            specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage
            class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Bulk</c> - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
            Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large
            amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within
            5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the
            lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
            They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

            You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster
            speed while it is in progress. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html">

            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <c>HEAD</c> request. Operations
            return the <c>x-amz-restore</c> header, which provides information about the restoration
            status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when
            a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring
            Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
            request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
            about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

            Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier
            Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of
            the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy
            of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived
            object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.
            For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved
            into the Frequent Access tier.

            When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access
            tier options in the <c>Tier</c> element of the request body:

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Expedited</c> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored
            in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required.
            For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
            retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
            that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
            retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3
            Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Standard</c> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
            within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not
            specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage
            class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Bulk</c> - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
            Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large
            amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within
            5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the
            lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
            They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

            You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster

            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <c>HEAD</c> request. Operations
            return the <c>x-amz-restore</c> header, which provides information about the restoration
            status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when
            a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring

            <para>
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
            request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
            about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

            When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access
            tier options in the <c>Tier</c> element of the request body: 
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Expedited</c> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored
            in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required.
            For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
            retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
            that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
            retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3
            Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Standard</c> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
            within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not
            specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage
            class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Bulk</c> - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
            Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large
            amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within
            5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the
            lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
            They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

            You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster

            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <c>HEAD</c> request. Operations
            return the <c>x-amz-restore</c> header, which provides information about the restoration
            status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when
            a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring

            <para>
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
            request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
            about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <c>HEAD</c> request. Operations
            return the <c>x-amz-restore</c> header, which provides information about the restoration
            status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when
            a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring

            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.

            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore

            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information

            <c>CreateSession</c> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,
            you grant the <c>s3express:CreateSession</c> permission to the directory bucket in
            a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <c>CreateSession</c>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <c>CreateSession</c> API call to generate a new session token for
            use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token
            automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information

             <b>General purpose bucket</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
            rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
            decrypts it when you access it. You have mutually exclusive options to protect data
            using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the
            encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys
            (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).
            Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
            by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side
            encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want

            <para>
            You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>

            operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call
            this <c>CompleteMultipartUpload</c> operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving
            this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number
            to create a new object. In the CompleteMultipartUpload request, you must provide the
            parts list and ensure that the parts list is complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload
            API operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in
            the list, you must provide the <c>PartNumber</c> value and the <c>ETag</c> value that
            are returned after that part was uploaded.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request could take several minutes to
            finalize. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response
            header that specifies a <c>200 OK</c> response. While processing is in progress, Amazon
            S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out.
            A request could fail after the initial <c>200 OK</c> response has been sent. This
            means that a <c>200 OK</c> response can contain either a success or an error. The
            error response might be embedded in the <c>200 OK</c> response. If you call this API
            operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of
            the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs

            Creates a session that establishes temporary security credentials to support fast
            authentication and authorization for the Zonal endpoint APIs on directory buckets.
            For more information about Zonal endpoint APIs that include the Availability Zone
            in the request endpoint, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-APIs.html">S3

            <para>
            To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory bucket, use the <c>CreateSession</c>
            API operation. Specifically, you grant <c>s3express:CreateSession</c> permission to
            a bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM credentials
            to make the <c>CreateSession</c> API request on the bucket, which returns temporary
            security credentials that include the access key ID, secret access key, session token,
            and expiration. These credentials have associated permissions to access the Zonal
            endpoint APIs. After the session is created, you don’t need to use other policies
            to grant permissions to each Zonal endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal
            endpoint API requests, you sign your requests by applying the temporary security credentials
            of the session to the request headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication.
            You also apply the session token to the <c>x-amz-s3session-token</c> request header
            for authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to the bucket and expire
            after 5 minutes. After the expiration time, any calls that you make with those credentials
            will fail. You must use IAM credentials again to make a <c>CreateSession</c> API request
            that generates a new set of temporary credentials for use. Temporary credentials cannot
            be extended or refreshed beyond the original specified interval.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle the session token refreshes automatically
            to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. We recommend that you use the
            Amazon Web Services SDKs to initiate and manage requests to the CreateSession API.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by
            automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without
            performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic
            cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
            storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate
            additional archiving capabilities.

            <para>
            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with
            unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or
            retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
            and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
            charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single
            HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation
            provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request
            overhead.
            
             
            <para>
            The request can contain a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the
            XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to
            delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each
            key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the result of that delete,
            success or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request
            is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

            of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the
            delete operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion in a quiet mode,
            the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by
            automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without
            performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic
            cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
            storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate
            additional archiving capabilities.

             <b>General purpose buckets</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
            rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
            decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that
            are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify
            encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts
            is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default,
            all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption
            with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption
            configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS)
            key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding
            KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform
            a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption
            setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object
            with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a
            customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from
            the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting
            in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key,
            the request headers you provide in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>

             <b>General purpose buckets</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
            rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
            decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that
            are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify
            encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts
            is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default,
            all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption
            with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption
            configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS)
            key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding
            KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform
            a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption
            setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object
            with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a
            customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from
            the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting
            in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key,
            the request headers you provide in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by
            automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without
            performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic
            cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
            storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate
            additional archiving capabilities.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with
            unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or
            retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
            and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
            charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads in a bucket. An in-progress multipart
            upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated by the <c>CreateMultipartUpload</c>
            request, but has not yet been completed or aborted.

            The <c>ListMultipartUploads</c> operation returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart uploads
            in the response. The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default value. You
            can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the <c>max-uploads</c>
            request parameter. If there are more than 1,000 multipart uploads that satisfy your
            <c>ListMultipartUploads</c> request, the response returns an <c>IsTruncated</c> element
            with the value of <c>true</c>, a <c>NextKeyMarker</c> element, and a <c>NextUploadIdMarker</c>
            element. To list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make subsequent <c>ListMultipartUploads</c>
            requests. In these requests, include two query parameters: <c>key-marker</c> and <c>upload-id-marker</c>.
            Set the value of <c>key-marker</c> to the <c>NextKeyMarker</c> value from the previous
            response. Similarly, set the value of <c>upload-id-marker</c> to the <c>NextUploadIdMarker</c>
            value from the previous response.

            <c>CreateSession</c> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,

            a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <c>CreateSession</c>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <c>CreateSession</c> API call to generate a new session token for
            use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token
            automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information

             <b>Directory bucket permissions</b> - To grant access to this API operation on a
            directory bucket, we recommend that you use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html">
            <c>CreateSession</c> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,
            you grant the <c>s3express:CreateSession</c> permission to the directory bucket in
            a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <c>CreateSession</c>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <c>CreateSession</c> API call to generate a new session token for
            use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token
            automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information
            about authorization, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html">

             </note> 
            <para>
            Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using
            either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application
            that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that
            approach.

            <para>
            If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs
            are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access
            to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and
            return the <c>AccessControlListNotSupported</c> error code. Requests to read ACLs
            are still supported. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html">Controlling

            You can set access permissions by using one of the following methods:

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Specify a canned ACL with the <c>x-amz-acl</c> request header. Amazon S3 supports
            a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined
            set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <c>x-amz-acl</c>.
            If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your
            request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned

            <c>x-amz-grant-write-acp</c>, and <c>x-amz-grant-full-control</c> headers. When using
            these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services
            accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific
            headers, you cannot use the <c>x-amz-acl</c> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters
            map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information,

            the <c>s3.amazonaws.com</c> global endpoint, the request goes to the <c>us-east-1</c>
            Region. So the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use <c>us-east-1</c>
            as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region
            where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US
            East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more

            By default, all buckets have a default encryption configuration that uses server-side
            encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). You can optionally configure default
            encryption for a bucket by using server-side encryption with Key Management Service
            (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services
            KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you specify default encryption by using SSE-KMS, you can also
            configure <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html">Amazon
            S3 Bucket Keys</a>. If you use PutBucketEncryption to set your <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-encryption.html">default
            bucket encryption</a> to SSE-KMS, you should verify that your KMS key ID is correct.
            Amazon S3 does not validate the KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by
            automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without
            performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic
            cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
            storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate
            additional archiving capabilities.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with
            unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or
            retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
            and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
            charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket on a daily
            or weekly basis, and the results are published to a flat file. The bucket that is
            inventoried is called the <i>source</i> bucket, and the bucket where the inventory
            flat file is stored is called the <i>destination</i> bucket. The <i>destination</i>

            In the case of Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions

            The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification
            configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When
            you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your
            SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will
            not add the configuration to your bucket.

            You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin

            To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the <c>cors</c>

            You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The lifecycle configuration
            is specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. An Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration

            By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related

            the resource owner (that is, the Amazon Web Services account that created it) can

            S3. You can retrieve, replace, or delete any version of the object. For more information

            <c>CreateSession</c> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,
            you grant the <c>s3express:CreateSession</c> permission to the directory bucket in
            a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <c>CreateSession</c>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <c>CreateSession</c> API call to generate a new session token for
            use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token

            Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier
            Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of
            the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy
            of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived
            object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.
            For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved
            into the Frequent Access tier.

            <para>
            To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide
            a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

            <para>
            When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access
            tier options in the <c>Tier</c> element of the request body: 
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Expedited</c> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored
            in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required.
            For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
            retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
            that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
            retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3
            Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Standard</c> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
            within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not
            specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage
            class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Bulk</c> - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
            Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large
            amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within
            5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the
            lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
            They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

            You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster

            <para>
            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <c>HEAD</c> request. Operations
            return the <c>x-amz-restore</c> header, which provides information about the restoration
            status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when
            a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring

            </para>
             
            <para>
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
            request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
            about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

            Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier
            Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of
            the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy
            of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived
            object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.
            For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved
            into the Frequent Access tier.

            To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide

            <para>
            When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access
            tier options in the <c>Tier</c> element of the request body: 
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Expedited</c> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored
            in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required.
            For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
            retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
            that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
            retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3
            Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Standard</c> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
            within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not
            specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage
            class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Bulk</c> - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
            Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large
            amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within
            5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the
            lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
            They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

            You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster

            <para>
            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <c>HEAD</c> request. Operations
            return the <c>x-amz-restore</c> header, which provides information about the restoration
            status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when
            a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring
            Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
            request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
            about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

            Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or
            S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier
            Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of
            the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy
            of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived
            object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.
            For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved
            into the Frequent Access tier.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide
            a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access
            tier options in the <c>Tier</c> element of the request body: 
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Expedited</c> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored
            in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required.
            For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
            retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
            that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
            retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3
            Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Standard</c> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
            within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not
            specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage
            class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Bulk</c> - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
            Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large
            amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within
            5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the
            lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
            They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

            You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster
            speed while it is in progress. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html">

            <para>
            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <c>HEAD</c> request. Operations
            return the <c>x-amz-restore</c> header, which provides information about the restoration
            status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when
            a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring
            Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
            request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
            about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

            Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or
            S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier
            Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of
            the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy
            of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived
            object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.
            For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved
            into the Frequent Access tier.

            <para>
            To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide
            a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access
            tier options in the <c>Tier</c> element of the request body:

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Expedited</c> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored
            in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required.
            For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
            retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
            that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
            retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3
            Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Standard</c> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects
            within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not
            specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage
            class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
             <c>Bulk</c> - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible
            Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large
            amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within
            5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the
            lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
            They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

            You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster
            speed while it is in progress. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html">

            <para>
            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <c>HEAD</c> request. Operations
            return the <c>x-amz-restore</c> header, which provides information about the restoration
            status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when
            a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring
            Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
            request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
            about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of
            the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy
            of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived
            object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.
            For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved
            into the Frequent Access tier.

            When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access

            in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required.
            For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited
            retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures
            that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited
            retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3
            Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

             </li> <li>

            within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not
            specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage
            class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours
            for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering
            Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

            amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within
            5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval
            storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the
            lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
            They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive

            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <c>HEAD</c> request. Operations
            return the <c>x-amz-restore</c> header, which provides information about the restoration
            status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when
            a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring

            <para>
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
            request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
            about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

            <c>CreateSession</c> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,

             <b>General purpose bucket</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at

            decrypts it when you access it. You have mutually exclusive options to protect data
            using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the
            encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys
            (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).
            Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
            by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side
            encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.
            </para>

            You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>
            operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call
            this action to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates
            all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete
            Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the
            parts list is complete. This action concatenates the parts that you provide in the
            list. For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the <code>ETag</code>
            value, returned after that part was uploaded.

            <para>
            Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete.
            After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that
            specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically
            sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request
            could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while
            Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts,
            you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation,
            the error response is embedded in the <code>200 OK</code> response. This means that
            a <code>200 OK</code> response can contain either a success or an error. Design your
            application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If you call
            the S3 API directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of
            the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs
            handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling
            per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate).
            If the condition persists, the SDKs throws an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't
            use exceptions, they return the error).

            Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are copied to an S3 bucket.
            When copying an object, if you don't specify encryption information in your copy request,
            the encryption setting of the target object is set to the default encryption configuration
            of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption
            configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).
            If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side
            encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided
            encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided
            key to encrypt the target object copy.

            <para>
            When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related
            headers to encrypt the object using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services
            managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key.
            With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks
            in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information
            about server-side encryption, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">Using

            When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions.
            By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When
            adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts
            or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to
            the ACL on the object. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access

            If the bucket that you're copying objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting
            for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets
            that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests
            that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the <code>bucket-owner-full-control</code>
            canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format.

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by
            automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without
            performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic
            cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
            storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate
            additional archiving capabilities.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with
            unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or
            retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
            and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
            charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the
            policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user
            of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must
            have the <code>DeleteBucketPolicy</code> permissions on the specified bucket and belong
            to the bucket owner's account to use this operation. 
            
             
            <para>
            If you don't have <code>DeleteBucketPolicy</code> permissions, Amazon S3 returns a
            <code>403 Access Denied</code> error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're
            not using an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns
            a <code>405 Method Not Allowed</code> error.

            As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns
            a bucket can always use this operation, even if the policy explicitly denies the root
            user the ability to perform this action.

            <para>
            The error message contains a generic description of the error condition in English.
            It is intended for a human audience. Simple programs display the message directly
            to the end user if they encounter an error condition they don't know how or don't
            care to handle. Sophisticated programs with more exhaustive error handling and proper
            internationalization are more likely to ignore the error message.

            the lifecycle configuration rules in the lifecycle subresource associated with the

            This operation enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single
            HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation
            provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request

            <para>
            The request can contain a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the
            XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to
            delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each
            key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the result of that delete,
            success or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request
            is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

            of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the
            delete operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion in a quiet mode,
            the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response body.

            When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete
            any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the
            entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to
            delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request

            <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,
            you grant the <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the directory bucket
            in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token
            for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token
            automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information

            <para>
            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            This implementation of the <code>GET</code> action uses the <code>acl</code> subresource
            to return the access control list (ACL) of a bucket. To use <code>GET</code> to return
            the ACL of the bucket, you must have the <code>READ_ACP</code> access to the bucket.
            If <code>READ_ACP</code> permission is granted to the anonymous user, you can return
            the ACL of the bucket without using an authorization header.

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by
            automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without
            performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic
            cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
            storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate
            additional archiving capabilities.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with
            unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or
            retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
            and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
            charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object
            key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this
            section describes the latest API. The response describes the new filter element that
            you can use to specify a filter to select a subset of objects to which the rule applies.
            If you are using a previous version of the lifecycle configuration, it still works.

            <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,
            you grant the <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the directory bucket
            in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token
            for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token
            automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            The <code>HEAD</code> operation retrieves metadata from an object without returning
            the object itself. This operation is useful if you're interested only in an object's
            metadata.
            
             
            <para>
            A <code>HEAD</code> request has the same options as a <code>GET</code> operation on
            an object. The response is identical to the <code>GET</code> response except that
            there is no response body. Because of this, if the <code>HEAD</code> request generates
            an error, it returns a generic code, such as <code>400 Bad Request</code>, <code>403
            Forbidden</code>, <code>404 Not Found</code>, <code>405 Method Not Allowed</code>,
            <code>412 Precondition Failed</code>, or <code>304 Not Modified</code>. It's not possible
            to retrieve the exact exception of these error codes.

            <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,
            you grant the <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the directory bucket
            in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.

            The base64-encoded encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the object
            <para>
            Using the encryption key you provide as part of your request Amazon S3 manages both the encryption, as it writes 
            to disks, and decryption, when you access your objects. Therefore, you don't need to maintain any data encryption code. The only 
            thing you do is manage the encryption keys you provide.
            </para>
            <para>
            When you retrieve an object, you must provide the same encryption key as part of your request. Amazon S3 first verifies 
            the encryption key you provided matches, and then decrypts the object before returning the object data to you.

            <p>Amazon S3 can return this header if your request involves a 
            bucket that is either a source or a destination in a replication rule.</p> <p>In replication,
            you have a source bucket on which you configure replication and destination bucket or buckets 
            where Amazon S3 stores object replicas. When you request an object (<code>GetObject</code>) or
            object metadata (<code>HeadObject</code>) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will 
            return the <code>x-amz-replication-status</code> header in the response as follows:</p> 
            <ul> <li> <p>If requesting an object from the source bucket, Amazon S3 will return the 
            <code>x-amz-replication-status</code> header if the object in your request is eligible for 
            replication.</p> <p> For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify 
            object prefix <code>TaxDocs</code> requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key 
            prefix <code>TaxDocs</code>. Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example 
            <code>TaxDocs/document1.pdf</code>, are eligible for replication. For any object request with 
            this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the <code>x-amz-replication-status</code> header 
            with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating object replication status.</p> </li> <li> <p>If 
            requesting an object from a destination bucket, Amazon S3 will return the 
            <code>x-amz-replication-status</code> header with value REPLICA if the object in your 
            request is a replica that Amazon S3 created.</p> </li> <li> <p>When replicating objects 
            to multiple destination buckets the <code>x-amz-replication-status</code> header acts differently. 
            The header of the source object will only return a value of COMPLETED when replication is 
            successful to all destinations. The header will remain at value PENDING until replication has 
            completed for all destinations. If one or more destinations fails replication the header will 
            return FAILED. </p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information,

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>

            <para>
            When Amazon S3 evaluates the <code>PublicAccessBlock</code> configuration for a bucket
            or an object, it checks the <code>PublicAccessBlock</code> configuration for both
            the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account.
            If the <code>PublicAccessBlock</code> settings are different between the bucket and
            the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and
            account-level settings.

            <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,

             <b>General purpose buckets</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at
            rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
            decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that
            are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify
            encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts
            is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default,
            all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption
            with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption
            configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS)
            key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding
            KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform
            a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption
            setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object
            with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a
            customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from
            the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting
            in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key,
            the request headers you provide in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html">UploadPart</a>

            <para>
            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by
            automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without
            performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic
            cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
            storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate
            additional archiving capabilities.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with
            unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or
            retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
            and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
            charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            The <code>ListMultipartUploads</code> operation returns a maximum of 1,000 multipart
            uploads in the response. The limit of 1,000 multipart uploads is also the default

            <code>max-uploads</code> request parameter. If there are more than 1,000 multipart
            uploads that satisfy your <code>ListMultipartUploads</code> request, the response
            returns an <code>IsTruncated</code> element with the value of <code>true</code>, a
            <code>NextKeyMarker</code> element, and a <code>NextUploadIdMarker</code> element.
            To list the remaining multipart uploads, you need to make subsequent <code>ListMultipartUploads</code>
            requests. In these requests, include two query parameters: <code>key-marker</code>
            and <code>upload-id-marker</code>. Set the value of <code>key-marker</code> to the

            <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,

            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token
            for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token
            automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information

            Container for the parameters to the ListParts operation.
            Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload.
            
             
            <para>
            To use this operation, you must provide the <code>upload ID</code> in the request.
            You obtain this uploadID by sending the initiate multipart upload request through
            <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html">CreateMultipartUpload</a>.

            <para>
            The <code>ListParts</code> request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The
            limit of 1,000 parts is also the default value. You can restrict the number of parts
            in a response by specifying the <code>max-parts</code> request parameter. If your
            multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an <code>IsTruncated</code>
            field with the value of <code>true</code>, and a <code>NextPartNumberMarker</code>
            element. To list remaining uploaded parts, in subsequent <code>ListParts</code> requests,
            include the <code>part-number-marker</code> query string parameter and set its value
            to the <code>NextPartNumberMarker</code> field value from the previous response.

             <b>Directory bucket permissions</b> - To grant access to this API operation on a

            <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,
            you grant the <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the directory bucket
            in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token
            for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token
            automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information

            <para>
            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            "Bad actions" are those that could expose the data inside a bucket to reads or writes

            <code>s3:GetObjectVersion</code>, and <code>s3:GetObjectAcl</code> are all bad actions.

            ACLs</a>. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have the <code>WRITE_ACP</code> permission.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Specify the ACL in the request body

            <para>
            Specify permissions using request headers

             </li> </ul> <note> 
            <para>
            You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.
            </para>
             </note> 
            <para>
            Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using
            either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application
            that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that
            approach.
            </para>
             <important> 
            <para>
            If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs
            are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access
            to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and
            return the <code>AccessControlListNotSupported</code> error code. Requests to read
            ACLs are still supported. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html">Controlling

            <para>
            You can set access permissions by using one of the following methods:
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports
            a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined
            set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-acl</code>.
            If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your
            request. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL">Canned
            ACL</a>.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>,
            <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers.
            When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon
            Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you
            use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to
            set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports
            in an ACL. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">Access

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs by
            automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without
            performance impact or operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic
            cost savings in three low latency and high throughput access tiers. To get the lowest
            storage cost on data that can be accessed in minutes to hours, you can choose to activate
            additional archiving capabilities.

            <para>
            The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is the ideal storage class for data with
            unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or
            retention period. If the size of an object is less than 128 KB, it is not monitored
            and not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored, but they are always
            charged at the Frequent Access tier rates in the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

            Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket on a daily
            or weekly basis, and the results are published to a flat file. The bucket that is
            inventoried is called the <i>source</i> bucket, and the bucket where the inventory
            flat file is stored is called the <i>destination</i> bucket. The <i>destination</i>
            bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the <i>source</i> bucket.

            daily or weekly. You can also configure what object metadata to include and whether
            to inventory all object versions or only current versions. For more information, see

            Set the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for who can view
            and modify the logging parameters. All logs are saved to buckets in the same Amazon
            Web Services Region as the source bucket. To set the logging status of a bucket, you
            must be the bucket owner.

            <para>
            The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. You use the <code>Grantee</code>
            request element to grant access to other people. The <code>Permissions</code> request
            element specifies the kind of access the grantee has to the logs.

            If the target bucket for log delivery uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3
            Object Ownership, you can't use the <code>Grantee</code> request element to grant
            access to others. Permissions can only be granted using policies. For more information,

            In the case of Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions

            By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However,
            bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this
            configuration with the required <code>s3:PutBucketNotification</code> permission.

            The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification
            configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When
            you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your
            SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will
            not add the configuration to your bucket.

            A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum
            of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects
            in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a
            rule for each subset.

            Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an object
            key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both. Accordingly, this
            section describes the latest API. The previous version of the API supported filtering
            based only on an object key name prefix, which is supported for backward compatibility.
            For the related API description, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html">PutBucketLifecycle</a>.

            You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The lifecycle configuration
            is specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. An Amazon S3 Lifecycle configuration
            can have up to 1,000 rules. This limit is not adjustable. Each rule consists of the
            following:
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            A filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies. The filter can
            be based on a key name prefix, object tags, or a combination of both.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>

            <para>
            One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you want Amazon S3 to
            perform on the objects identified by the filter. If the state of your bucket is versioning-enabled
            or versioning-suspended, you can have many versions of the same object (one current
            version and zero or more noncurrent versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions
            that you can specify for current and noncurrent object versions.

            By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and related
            subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website configuration). Only
            the resource owner (that is, the Amazon Web Services account that created it) can
            access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access permissions to
            others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user must get the <code>s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration</code>
            permission.

            <para>
            You can also explicitly deny permissions. An explicit deny also supersedes any other
            permissions. If you want to block users or accounts from removing or deleting objects
            from your bucket, you must deny them permissions for the following actions:

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,
            you grant the <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the directory bucket
            in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token
            for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token
            automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information

            If the bucket that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting

            that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the <code>bucket-owner-full-control</code>
            canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT requests
            that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain Amazon Web Services
            accounts) fail and return a <code>400</code> error with the error code <code>AccessControlListNotSupported</code>.

            data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage
            the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed
            keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS), and customer-provided
            keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption by using Amazon
            S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt
            data at rest by using server-side encryption with other key options. For more information,

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.

            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like

            the bucket (or the bucket that contains the object) and the bucket owner's account.
            If the <code>PublicAccessBlock</code> configurations are different between the bucket
            and the account, Amazon S3 uses the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level
            and account-level settings.

            For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering,
            you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved

            Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives
            are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using
            Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity
            ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need
            it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored

            speed while it is in progress. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html">

            To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request.
            Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information
            about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications
            to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see
            <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring
            Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.

            <para>
            After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing
            the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to
            the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges.
            You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your
            current restore request for the object.

            <para>
            If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration
            action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore
            request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is
            scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information
            about lifecycle configuration, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html">PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a>

            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            Represents an access control list (ACL) for S3. An AccessControlList is represented by an Owner,
            and a List of Grants, where each Grant is a Grantee and a Permission.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            Each bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an ACL that defines its access control policy.
            When a request is made, Amazon S3 authenticates the request using its standard
            authentication procedure and then checks the ACL to verify the sender was granted access
            to the bucket or object. If the sender is approved, the request proceeds.
            Otherwise, Amazon S3 returns an error.
            </para>
            <para>
            An ACL is a list of grants. A grant consists of one grantee and one permission.
            ACLs only grant permissions; they do not deny them.
            </para>
            <para>
            For convenience, some commonly used Access Control Lists are defined in
            S3CannedACL.
            </para>
            <para>
            Note: BucketName and object ACLs are completely independent; an object does not inherit the ACL
            from its bucket. For example, if you create a bucket and grant write access to another user,
            you will not be able to access the user's objects unless the user explicitly grants access.
            This also applies if you grant anonymous write access to a bucket. Only the user "anonymous"
            will be able to access objects the user created unless permission is explicitly granted to
            the bucket owner.
            </para>
            <para>
            Important: We highly recommend that you do not grant the anonymous group write access to your
            buckets as you will have no control over the objects others can store and their associated charges.

            <remarks>
            <para>
            Every bucket and object in Amazon S3 has an owner, the user that
            created the bucket or object. The owner of a bucket or object cannot
            be changed. However, if the object is overwritten by another user
            (deleted and rewritten), the new object will have a new owner.
            </para>
            <para>
            Note: Even the owner is subject to the ACL. For example, if an owner
            does not have Permission.READ access to an object, the owner cannot read
            that object. However, the owner of an object always has write access to the
            access control policy (Permission.WriteAcp) and can change the ACL to
            read the object.

            <para>
            The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes only to the contents
            of an object, not its metadata. The ETag may or may not be an MD5 digest of the object
            data. Whether or not it is depends on how the object was created and how it is encrypted
            as described below:
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or through the
            Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted by SSE-S3 or plaintext,
            have ETags that are an MD5 digest of their object data.

            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            If an object is created by either the Multipart Upload or Part Copy operation, the
            ETag is not an MD5 digest, regardless of the method of encryption. If an object is
            larger than 16 MB, the Amazon Web Services Management Console will upload or copy
            that object as a Multipart Upload, and therefore the ETag will not be an MD5 digest.

            must also specify a data serialization format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the
            object. Amazon S3 uses this format to parse object data into records, and returns

            before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns

            <code>CreateSession</code> </a> API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically,
            you grant the <code>s3express:CreateSession</code> permission to the directory bucket
            in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the <code>CreateSession</code>
            API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request
            header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires,
            you make another <code>CreateSession</code> API call to generate a new session token
            for use. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token
            automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information
            about authorization, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateSession.html">

             <b>General purpose bucket</b> - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at

            decrypts it when you access it. You have mutually exclusive options to protect data
            using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the
            encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys
            (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C).
            Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)
            by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side
            encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want
            to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key (SSE-C).

            <para>
            This property will be used as part of the resource path of the HTTP request. In .NET the System.Uri class
            is used to construct the uri for the request. The System.Uri class will canonicalize the uri string by compacting characters like "..". 
            For example an object key of "foo/../bar/file.txt" will be transformed into "bar/file.txt" because the ".." 
            is interpreted as use parent directory.
            </para>
            <para>
            Starting with .NET 8, the AWS .NET SDK disables System.Uri's feature of canonicalizing the resource path. This allows S3 keys like
            "foo/../bar/file.txt" to work correctly with the AWS .NET SDK.

            Using the encryption key you provide as part of your request Amazon S3 manages both the encryption, as it writes

            IntelligentTiering makes it easy to lower your overall cost of storage by automatically placing data in the storage
            class that best matches the access patterns for the storage. With IntelligentTiering, you don’t need to define
            and manage individual policies for lifecycle data management or write code to transition objects
            between storage classes. Instead, you can use IntelligentTiering to manage transitions between Standard and
            S-IA without writing any application code. IntelligentTiering also manages transitions automatically to
            Glacier for long term archive in addition to S3 storage classes.

            If a multipart upload is interrupted, TransferUtility will attempt to abort the multipart upload. 
            Under certain circumstances (network outage, power failure, etc.), TransferUtility will not be able

STANDARD mode will be used if the execution environment cannot be determined. The auto detection might query <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">EC2 Instance Metadata service</a>, which might introduce latency.

             <summary>
             Was the value of the UseSignatureVersion4 property set explicitly?
             This can be done via configuration or by directly setting the property.
            
             This is used to determine if the user set UseSignatureVersion4 to true,
             or if it's true because the default was changed to true in the SDK.
