  of an UxrGrabbableObject. The UxrGrabbableObject inspector automatically disables the
  controlled UI sections and has also capability to show/hide the controlled parameters.

  sends input data.

  after custom constraints have been applied.  
- Rename UxrLocomotionTeleportBaseEditor to UxrTeleportLocomotionBaseEditor.
- Update example scene prefabs so that they show the cyborg grab poses by default.

### Fixed

- Fix bug in UxrGrabbableObjectEditor that under some circumstances throws exceptions
  when previewing grab poses.
