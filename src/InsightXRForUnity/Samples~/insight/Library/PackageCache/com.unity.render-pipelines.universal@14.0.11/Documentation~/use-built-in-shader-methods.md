# Shader methods in URP

The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) has a library of High-Level Shader Language (HLSL) shader files that contain helper methods. You can import these files into your custom shader files and use the helper methods.

|**Page**|**Description**|
|-|-|
|[Import a file from the URP shader library](use-built-in-shader-methods-import.md)|Use the `#include` directive in HLSL to import a URP shader file.|
|[Transform positions in a custom URP shader](use-built-in-shader-methods-transformations.md)|Transform vertex, fragment, normal and tangent positions between coordinate spaces.|
|[Use the camera in a custom URP shader](use-built-in-shader-methods-camera.md)|Get the position and direction of the camera.|
|[Use lighting in a custom URP shader](use-built-in-shader-methods-lighting.md)|Get the lights in a scene, and calculate lighting.|
|[Use shadows in a custom URP shader](use-built-in-shader-methods-shadows.md)|Get shadow data from lights in the scene, and calculate shadows.|
