# Lazy Follow

Makes the GameObject this component is attached to follow a target with a delay and some other layout options.

| **Target** | (Optional) The object being followed. If not set, this will default to the main camera when this component is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Target Offset** | The amount to offset the target's position when following. This position is relative/local to the target object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Follow In LocalSpace** | If true, read the local transform of the target to lazy follow, otherwise read the world transform. If using look at rotation follow modes, only world-space follow is supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Apply In LocalSpace** | If true, apply the target offset in local space. If false, apply the target offset in world space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Movement Speed** | Interpolation multiplier used when smoothing to new target. Acts as the lower bound speed, this value approaches its double as it converges on its target.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Movement Speed Variance Percentage** | Adjust movement speed based on distance from the target using a tolerance percentage. 0% for constant speed. For example, with a variance of 25% (0.25), and a speed of 6, the upper bound is 7.5, which is reached as the target is approached. If the target is far from the object, the speed will trend toward the lower bound, which would be 4.5 in this case. |
| **Snap On Enable** | Snap to target position when this component is enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Position Follow Mode** | Determines the follow mode used to determine a new rotation. Look At is best used with the target being the main camera.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Min Distance Allowed** | Minimum distance from target before which a follow lazy follow starts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Max Distance Allowed** | Maximum distance from target before lazy follow targets, when time threshold is reached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Time Until Threshold Reaches Max Distance** | Time required to elapse (in seconds) before allowed distance goes from the minimum distance allowed to the the maximum distance allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| **Time Until Threshold Reaches Max Angle** | Time required to elapse (in seconds) before the max angle offset allowed goes from the min angle offset to the max.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
