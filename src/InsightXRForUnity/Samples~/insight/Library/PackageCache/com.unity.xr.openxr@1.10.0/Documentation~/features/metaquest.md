# Meta Quest Support

In order to deploy to Meta Quest, enable the Meta Quest Support feature on the Android build target:

1. Open the Project Settings window (menu: **Edit > Project Settings**).
2. Select the **XR Plug-in Management** from the list of settings on the left.
3. If necessary, enable **OpenXR** in the list of **Plug-in Providers**. Unity installs the OpenXR plug-in, if not already installed.
4. Select the OpenXR settings page under XR Plug-in Management.
5. Add the **Oculus Touch Controller Profile** to the **Interaction Profiles** list. (You can have multiple profiles enabled in the list, the OpenXR chooses the one to use based on the current device at runtime.)
6. Enable **Meta Quest Support** under **OpenXR Feature Groups**.

The Android apks that are produced with Quest support enabled can be run on the Quest family of devices.
See the [XR](xref:XR) section of the Unity Manual for more information about developing VR games and applications.
