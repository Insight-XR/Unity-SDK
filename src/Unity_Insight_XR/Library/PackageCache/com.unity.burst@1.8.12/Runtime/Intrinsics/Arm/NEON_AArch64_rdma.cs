This instruction multiplies the vector elements of the first source SIMD&amp;FP register with the value of a vector element of the second source SIMD&amp;FP register without saturating the multiply results, doubles the results, and subtracts the most significant half of the final results from the vector elements of the destination SIMD&amp;FP register. The results are rounded.If any of the results overflow, they are saturated. The cumulative saturation bit, FPSR.QC, is set if saturation occurs.Depending on the settings in the CPACR_EL1, CPTR_EL2, and CPTR_EL3 registers, and the current Security state and Exception level, an attempt to execute the instruction might be trapped.
