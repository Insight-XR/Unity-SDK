    "changelog": "### Fixed\n- Fixed the managed fallback for bursts intrinsic functions `cvt_ss2si`, `cvtss_si32`, and `cvtss_si64` to follow midpoint rounding standard of nearest even.\n- Fixed an issue where use of certain intrinsics could cause a compile error even if properly guarded by the appropriate `IsXXXSupported` property.\n- If an exception is thrown from burst compiled code in the Editor on Windows there was potential for certain callee saved registers to be corrupted.  In order to fix this ( editor only - player builds are unaffected), we now save some additional context on each entry point.\n- Fixed burst not differentiating between overloaded generic functions such as T foo(int val) and T foo(T val) when the function calls are foo(1); foo<int>(1). Burst would previously only compile the T foo(T val) function.\n- Fixed android builds throwing a NullReferenceException.\n- Fixed arithmetic and bitwise negation on native integers.\n- Fixed an issue where underflows of nint and nuint at compile time would lead to incorrect code.\n- Burst recompiles assemblies due to hashes mismatching because of the way assembly defines are combined into the hash.\n- Fixed constant SHUFFLE function not seen as a constant when called indirectly through a `FunctionPointer`\n\n### Added\n\n### Removed\n\n### Changed\n- Update default LLVM to version 16\n\n### Known Issues"
