In some cases, you may not be able to update the Unity Editor or may wish to manually install the latest verified or preview version of XRI. To do this, follow these steps: 
1. Open your project folder in File Explorer, Finder or equivalent file browser.
1. Navigate to the `Packages` folder and then open the `manifest.json` file in your favorite text editor.

If you are installing XRI for the first time, paste the following line into your manifest file inside of the `dependencies` block: **"com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit": "[!include[](includes/version.md)]",** making sure to add commas to preserve a valid json structure.
1. Save the file and close.
1. Return to your project or open the project back up and ensure there are no errors related to the changes you just made.
1. Open `Package Manager` and verify that the list now XR Interaction Toolkit with the correct version.

## Input System

This package has a dependency on [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/manual/index.html). If that package has not already been installed, Unity will automatically add it to your Project. You might see a prompt asking you to enable input backends. Click **Yes** to accept it. For more information, see [Enabling the new input backends](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/manual/Installation.html#enabling-the-new-input-backends) in the Input System package documentation.

You may see a prompt asking you to upgrade your interaction layers in your project assets. If you're installing the XR Interaction Toolkit for the first time in your project, click **No Thanks** to skip. If you are upgrading from an older package version prior to 2.0.0, then it's recommended to update the interaction layer masks by clicking **I Made a Backup, Go Ahead!**.
